# Water Balance Visualization

## Overview

This is a personal project in Python designed to visualize water balance data. It uses `geopandas` and `matplotlib` to create animated plots of water balance components over time.

## Features

- Animated plots of water balance data
- Clear color differentiation for percolation and surface runoff ranges

## Requirements

- `geopandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas` (if used for data handling)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
    ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-balance-visualization.git
   cd water-balance-visualization
   ```

2. Install the necessary Python libraries: `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.

## Running the Script

1. Ensure your data files are prepared. The script requires three specific files for the animation.

2. Run the Python script to generate the animated plot.

3. View the output for the animated plot.
